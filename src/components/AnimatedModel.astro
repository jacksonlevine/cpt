<!--The model/canvas doesn't actually exist here, 
this just tells the parent canvas to load it & reserves some layout room for it. Previously "logo-dummy",
but now it both "declares" the model and reserves its page layout space which seems more sensible

This only works if a parent above it contains a FullSizeCanvas as a child-->
